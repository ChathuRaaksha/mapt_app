    "problem_description": "Travelers today are bombarded with endless recommendations, making it difficult to decide where to go and what to do. Popular destinations suffer from overcrowding, leading to a loss of authenticity and an unsustainable strain on local communities and the environment.

Without a way to truly connect with a place, travel can feel repetitive, uninspiring, and even harmful to the places we visit.",
